## 3. Frontend Manual Testing Guide

### Test Environment Setup
- **Backend**: http://localhost:8000 ✅ Running
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000 ✅ Running
- **Login Credentials**:
  - Email: admin@mdc.com

- ✅ Proper notification icons and colors based on type/category
- ✅ Time stamps show "Just now", "X minutes ago", etc.

### 3.2 Sidebar Notification Menu Testing

#### Test Steps:
1. **Locate** the "Notifications" menu item in the sidebar
2. **Verify** the red badge shows "10" (same as header)
3. **Wait 30 seconds** without interacting
4. **Observe** if both header and sidebar counts remain synchronized

#### Expected Results:
- ✅ Sidebar badge shows "10"
- ✅ Count matches header badge exactly
- ✅ Both update simultaneously during 30-second polling

### 3.3 Notification Page Testing

#### Test Steps:
1. **Click** on "Notifications" in the sidebar or "View All Notifications" in header dropdown
2. **Verify** the notifications page loads with:
   - Filter tabs: All, Unread, System, Transactions, Users
   - Notification groups: Today, Yesterday, This Week, Older
   - Action buttons: Mark as Read, Mark All as Read, Clear All

#### Expected Results:
- ✅ Page loads successfully
- ✅ Notifications grouped by time periods
- ✅ 10 notifications appear under "Today" (unread)
- ✅ Proper notification type icons and colors

### 3.4 Notification Actions Testing

#### Test Case: Individual Mark as Read
1. **Find** an unread notification (has light background)
2. **Click** the "Mark as Read" button on the notification
3. **Verify** the notification background changes (no longer highlighted)
4. **Check** header and sidebar counts decrease by 1

#### Test Case: Mark All as Read
1. **Click** the "Mark All as Read" button at the top
2. **Verify** all notifications lose their unread highlighting
3. **Check** header and sidebar badges disappear (count becomes 0)

#### Test Case: Clear All Notifications
1. **Click** the "Clear All" button
2. **Verify** confirmation dialog appears
3. **Click** "Confirm" in the dialog
4. **Verify** all notifications are removed
5. **Check** page shows "No notifications" message

### 3.5 Filter Tabs Testing

#### Test Steps:
1. **Click** each filter tab in sequence:
   - **All**: Shows all notifications
   - **Unread**: Shows only unread notifications (should show badge count)
   - **System**: Shows only system-type notifications
   - **Transactions**: Shows only transaction-type notifications
   - **Users**: Shows only user-type notifications

#### Expected Results:
- ✅ Each filter correctly displays relevant notifications
- ✅ Unread tab shows badge with count
- ✅ Type-specific filters show appropriate notifications

### 3.6 Bilingual Support Testing

#### Test Steps:
1. **Click** the "AR" button in the header language toggle
2. **Verify** the interface switches to Arabic:
   - Header notification dropdown labels
   - Sidebar notification menu text
   - Notification page labels and buttons
   - Filter tab names
   - Time grouping labels (اليوم، أمس، هذا الأسبوع، أقدم)

3. **Click** the "EN" button to switch back to English
4. **Verify** all labels return to English

#### Expected Results:
- ✅ Complete interface translation
- ✅ Right-to-left layout for Arabic
- ✅ Proper Arabic notification group labels
- ✅ Seamless language switching

### 3.7 Real-Time Polling Testing

#### Test Steps:
1. **Open** browser developer tools (F12)
2. **Go** to Network tab
3. **Wait** and observe network requests every 30 seconds
4. **Look** for requests to `/api/v1/notifications/notifications/unread_count/`

#### Expected Results:
- ✅ Automatic API calls every 30 seconds
- ✅ Header and sidebar counts update automatically
- ✅ No user interaction required for updates

### 3.8 Error Handling Testing

#### Test Case: Backend Disconnection

3. **Verify** graceful error handling (no crashes)
4. **Restart** backend server
5. **Verify** functionality resumes automatically

#### Expected Results:
